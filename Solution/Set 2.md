# Set 2

## Q1

#### Explain with an example what task is performed by Algorithm 2.

For example visit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-insertion-sort/

#### Find the complexity of  the algorithm

1. We are calling the same function recursively for each element of the array and inside the function, we are looping with a condition that that the previous elements should be greater than the last element, So Time complexity is different for different case.</br>

    1. Best Case: O(n)
    2. Average and worst Case: O(n^2)

2. We are recursively calling the function for each element of the array, So space complexity is O(n).

#### Can you identify the type of algorithm?

`Algorithm 1 is performing Recursive Insertion Sort`
